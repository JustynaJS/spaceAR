# spaceAR
This project is a XR application developed during MIT Reality Hack 2020. 

## Overwiew
SpaceAR is an XR application for hackathon space planning. With a use of Hololens 2, a user can see through a headset a space planner. It displays a set of different rooms like: Hackers space, Mentors Space, Hardware space, Relax space etc. The user can move the spaces, getting immediate feedback of the area and posssible number of hackers that can fit inside this space.

To understand the results better, the analytics is provided where 8 scale bars are repesenting the selected parameters like distance from the mentors space to the hackers space. The better proposed layout - the higher score bars. Therefore, user can get real-time feedback on the layout proposal. 

To compare all created layout, user can get into the history mode, where with the slider all the previos states can be displayed. 

# How to
Start the SpaceAR app, then start to move spaces to fit the layout you like. To turn on the space tooltips with space name, area and possible number of hackers, klick button on the left called "Space info". To see the scoring bars, turn on the "Turn Analytics button". To preview the history, turn on the "History" button and move the slider to travel back to specific place in history.

Additionally to that, more spaces can be added. Additional spaces are in the floating panel on the right. Just grab additional box and place in on the grid.
